      <p>
        Kubernetes Community Days Australia brings together hundreds of IT executives, cloud operators, and technology providers to discuss cloud computing and to learn about Kubernetes. KCD Australia is supported by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation and organized by supporting companies.
      </p>

      <p>
        KCD events are an excellent way to get to know the community and share your ideas and the work that you are doing. You do not need to be a chief architect or long-time industry pundit to submit a proposal, in fact, we strongly encourage first-time speakers to submit talks for all of our events.
      </p>

      <p>
        Feel free to submit a proposal <a href="https://kcd.smapply.io/prog/kcd_australia_cfp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.
